## Introduction

The Exchange Rates API provides comprehensive currency management functionality, supporting both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. All exchange rates are expressed relative to CNY (Chinese Yuan) as the base currency.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Manage fiat currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, etc.) and cryptocurrencies (USDT, BTC, ETH)
- **Rate Validation**: ±5% tolerance based on market rates to prevent input errors
- **Base Currency Protection**: CNY as base currency (rate fixed at 1) cannot be modified or deleted
- **Auto-Sync**: Optional automatic synchronization from external APIs
- **Business Integration**: Warnings when modifying currencies used by diamond/subscription services

## Rate Validation

All rate inputs are validated against a ±5% tolerance from base market rates:

```
Allowed Range = Base Rate × (1 ± 5%)

Example for USDT (Base: 7.2):
- Minimum: 7.2 × 0.95 = 6.84
- Maximum: 7.2 × 1.05 = 7.56
```

<Warning>
  Rates outside the ±5% tolerance will be **rejected** to prevent accidental input errors.
</Warning>

## Base Currency Protection

CNY is the base currency and has special protections:

- Rate is fixed at 1 and cannot be modified
- Cannot be deleted
- Cannot be disabled
- Does not require sync
